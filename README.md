# Project 10
Project 10 in the web developer bootcamp @Yandex Practicum

This sprint was a quick introduction to React along with some of  the React ecosystem tools and modules.

The project is basically to port [Project 9](https://github.com/datvidc/web_project_4) to React.

This includes creating needed architecture with components- and re-doing the BEM CSS structure implemented in projects 4- 9
